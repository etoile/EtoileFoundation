    * GNUmakefile.postamble: Fixed framework build on Linux, probably related 
    to GNU Make. Unlike with BSD make, it looks like $PWD variable isn't 
    updated in recursive build, we must use special similar Make variable 
    $CURDIR.
    * Source/ToolSource/GNUmakefile: Replaced ukrun_LIB_DIRS with 
    ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS.

    * README.GNUstep: Added old README written by Nicolas Roard.

    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m: Modified to support GNUstep and 
    improved conditional compilation.
