	Implemented initialization for testing of projects based on AppKit or 
	EtoileUI, by creating the application class dynamically instead of directly 
	linking the frameworks (as previously done and disabled with r2298).
	* Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.h
	* Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m
	(-setUpAppObjectIfNeededForBundle:): New method.
	(-runTestsInBundle:): Modified to call the previous method.

	Added a growl notification (code borrowed from a more recent version
	of UnitKit than what we have in our repository, see
	http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2008/01/30/unitkit/).

	* Source/FrameworkSource/UKTestHandler.m
	* Source/FrameworkSource/English.lproj/UKTestHandler.strings:
	Added a new macro, UKObjectKindOf(a,b), that uses -isKindOfClass:
	Most of the time UKObjectsEqual([a class], [b class]) would be
	similar, but not always (i.e. NSCFArray/NSArray on OSX). Example:
	UKObjectKindOf(myObject, NSArray)

	class itself and class methods then with an uninitialized instance and 
	instance methods.

    Updated to take in account recent Xcode versions and bumped 
    UnitKit (GNUstep) version to 1.2.
    * Source/UnitKit.xcodeproj: Updated path references to 
    'Source/FrameworkSource/Info.plist', 'Source/TestSource/UnitKitTests/Info.plist', 
    'Source/TestSource/TestFramework/Info.plist', 'Source/TestSource/TestBundle/Info.plist'
    and 'Source/XcodeIntegration/FileTemplates/TemplateInfo.plist'.
    * Source/XcodeIntegration/TargetTemplates/UnitKitBundle.trgttmpl:
    Replaced $BUILD_DIR by $TARGET_BUILD_DIR to have the correct tests bundle 
    path (in Run Script phase context).
    * Source/FrameworkSource/Info.plist: Bumped version.

    UnitKit project seems to be no longer supported on Mac OS X (version 2.0 
    being never been released), then it's probably time to include complete
    Mac OS X support (with Xcode project and integration) in our own version. 
    That means UnitKit (GNUstep) specific features can now be used with Xcode 
    projects out of the box.
    * Source/UnitKit.xcodeproj
    * Source/XcodeIntegration/TargetTemplates/UnitKitBundle.trgttmpl:
    * Source/XcodeIntegration/FileTemplates/class.m:
    * Source/XcodeIntegration/FileTemplates/TemplateInfo.plist:
    * Source/XcodeIntegration/FileTemplates/class.h:
    * Source/Package/Info.plist:

    * Source/Package/Resources/License.txt:
    * Source/Package/Resources/Welcome.txt:
    * Source/Package/Resources/Readme.txt:
    * Source/Package/Description.plist:
    Added.

    * INSTALL: Added.
    * README.GNUstep: Updated for release 0.1.

2005-06-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * GNUmakefile.postamble: Fixed framework build on Linux, probably related 
    to GNU Make. Unlike with BSD make, it looks like $PWD variable isn't 
    updated in recursive build, we must use special similar Make variable 
    $CURDIR.
    * Source/ToolSource/GNUmakefile: Replaced ukrun_LIB_DIRS with 
    ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS.

2005-03-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m:.
    (-runTests:onClass:): Activated conditional compilation in order UnitKit
    uses new try/catch exception model on Mac OS X.

    * Source/FrameworkSource/UnitKit.h: Added new line at end of file to avoid 
    compiler warning when you include this file.

    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m:
    (-runTests:onClass:): Reactivated support to catch exceptions thrown by
    tests objects (code was commented).

    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.h:
    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m:
    Added workaround to correct problem with AppKit import declaration (UnitKit
    should compile now).
    * Source/FrameworkSource/GNUmakefile: Improved look :-).

2005-03-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * ChangeLog: Added.
    * README.GNUstep: Added old README written by Nicolas Roard.
    * GNUmakefile: Updated.
    * Source/FrameworkSource/GNUmakefile: Modified to build a library and not a
    framework (GNUstep framework support on Mac OS X isn't perfect).
    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKTask.m: Updated to work without Carbon.
    * Source/FrameworkSource/UKRunner.m: Modified to support GNUstep and 
    improved conditional compilation.
    (UKTestClasseNamesFromBundle()): Added code to handle tested classes with 
    categories.
    (-runTests:onClass:): Added AppKit related testing support and support for
    messages -initForTest -releaseForTest sent to test objects.
    * Source/ToolSource/GNUmakefile: Removed framework link.
