/** @group Debugging
@abstract A debug utility to record stack traces in relation to an instance.

A stack trace recorder allows to snapshot the call stack symbols and 
inspect these snapshots later on.

You invoke -recordForObject: to snapshot the current call stack symbols and 
-recordedStackTracesForObject: to get all the call stack traces recorded until 
now. 

A stack trace recorder is very handy to debug memory management issues. e.g. 
You can easily discover where an over-released object was allocated in a vein 
similar to <em>malloc_history</em> on Mac OS X.<br />
Take note that +enableAllocationRecordingForClass: is only available on GNUstep 
and the example detailed below doesn't apply to Mac OS X where you must use 
malloc_history instead.<br />
To get meaningfull backtrace on GNUstep, you must install the GNU bin utils 
(e.g. binutils-dev package on Ubuntu) and configure GNUstep Base with 
<em>--enable-bfd</em>.<br /> 
Be aware that the resulting gnustep-base library will be GPL-licensed and 
transively all the code that links it will become GPL-licensed too.

@section Use Case Example

For a retain/release crash, note the instance class that got double-released, 
then add in main() or equivalent:

<example>[[ETStackTraceRecorder sharedInstance] enableAllocationRecordingForClass: [MyClass class]];</example>

To prevent the instance to be deallocated, set NSZombieEnabled to YES (e.g. 
<em>export NSZombieEnabled YES</em> in the shell). Finally compile and run the 
program in GDB and at crash time, type on the GDB prompt:

<example>po [[ETStackTraceRecorder sharedInstance] recordedStackTracesForObject: instance] firstObject]</example>

Where <em>instance</em> is the instance address or a variable pointing on the 
instance. Then GDB prints the stack trace which points back to the code that 
allocated the instance.<br />
You can also put a breakpoint on -[NSZombie forwardInvocation:], but take note 
that NSZombie doesn't respond to -recordedStackTraces (at least on GNUstep).

@section Thread Safety

ETStackTraceRecorder is thread-safe (not fully yet), multiple threads can invoke 
-recordForObject:. */

You can use these methods to record stack traces with 
+[ETStackTraceRecorder sharedInstance].

For example, in GDB you can type [self recordStackTrace] to keep a trace of the 
current call stack.<br />
And you can print all the stack traces recorded for the current object with 
'po [[self recordedStackTraces] stringValue]'. */
