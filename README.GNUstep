Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL document.


Mac OS X support
----------------

Please use original UnitKit unless portability is considered.
UnitKit (GNUstep) is compatible with Cocoa.


How to use UnitKit with GNUstep-make
------------------------------------

You need to compile your sources as a bundle. Here is a GNUmakefile example:

    include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

    BUNDLE_NAME = Test
    Test_OBJC_FILES = # your sources and test classes...
    Test_OBJC_LIBS = -lUnitKit

    include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/bundle.make

Then, just type:

    * ukrun Test.bundle

And you should have the list of the tests and their status. If somebody want to add UnitKit support to ProjectCenter (the GNUstep IDE) or even work on the standalone graphical launcher UnitTests, be sure it will be appreciated :-)


UnitTests utility
-----------------

It is still in very rough state, but you can take a look at it in the repository just here: /trunk/Etoile/Developer/Services/UnitTests


Developer notes
===============

Tests suite (to test UnitKit with itself)
-----------------------------------------

UnitKit (bundled with Etoile) is required.

    Steps to produce a test bundle and run tests suite:

    * make test=yes 

    * ukrun UnitKit.bundle


Dependency
---------

None.
